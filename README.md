## Background

Dolos - Greek God of Deception

A system that detects potential deception (see what I did there) and returns a result. Each item can be given a score, and if multiple elements are matched, a total score is calculated. Of course you may only want to get back a boolean value to return if its found, so it does that too

Part of A.E.G.I.S. (_Advanced E-Commerce Gateway and Ingress Service_)
